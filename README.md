# Assignment 6

Please note: Bude.R and Bude.Rmd both run properly in the console, but knitr was stuggling to knit the Rmd file. It took me a couple of tries to get it to compile to a PDF, but the code does work.  

## Bude exploration

- Find the town of Bude in Western England. This is a town that is well-known as a beach resort. You're going to make two maps of Bude – a road map and a watercolor map.
- On both maps, mark the map with vacation spots you might like: surfing beaches and the cricket grounds (one of the most stunning the the country and very local). Pick two local beaches (this will require some googling).
- Finally find a pub that is convenient to the cricket grounds. Mark the route from the grounds to the pub.

## Make a document

- The deliverable is a PDF document.
- Your finished document should contain the maps and pictures of the places that are marked. Make sure that there is appropriate structure in the document. Add text to suit – perhaps text you grab off one of the websites you visit to make your document.
- Save the document, put it in your git repo, commit, push to your github.

## Use github Fork - Pull request

- Now go to the github list on Blackboard and find the person whose code you will to modify.
- Fork the code and make a change. One change you might consider is adding 2 or 3 local hotels to the map. Don't forget to add pictures.
- Push the new code and issue a pull request.
- Someone will have been doing a similar change to your code. You should see a notification on your github that there is a pull request.
- Merge the code. Pull the merged code to your Rproj directory.
